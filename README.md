NBA Network Analysis and Machine Learning

## Environment
```
python 3.12.7
macOS
```

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Players Network
Predict players who have never been on the same team before and have good chemistry.

### pipeline script
You can run the pipeline script.
```
sh pipeline.sh
```

### pipeline steps
- download the data
- preprocess the data
- train the model
- predict the players who have never been on the same team before and have good chemistry.
